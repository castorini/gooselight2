It is a colorimetric detection. \u03bcPAD are pre-dropped by reagents that can react with specific nutrients in water to show color change. The color intensity has linear function with the nutrient concentration, then the nutrient concentration can be obtained by measuring the color intensity, by using a camera and image processing. To realize the automated real-time nutrients detection in water areas by using \u03bcPADs, there are three steps: 1) to automate sampling from water areas e.g., by using an auto-piptette, or a pump, 2) to automate the nutrients detection using \u03bcPADs. Note, that one piece of \u03bcPAD can only be used to measure one water sample. A pack of \u03bcPADs should be stored to detect a series of water samples; therefore, components should be integrated to automatically transport a \u03bcPAD from the storage container to the detection zone under the camera, and move the used \u03bcPAD from the detection zone to the waste container. 3) to communicate the measured data to a GSM modem equipped laptop, via SMS, so that researchers using the sensor can easily track in real-time the nutrients level remotely.\nA functionalized nylon filter has been developed to remove oil contaminants from water samples, in case the oil interferes with the nutrient detection. This developed nylon filter would be used before the water is detected by using the sensor.", "dc_format_s": "Paper", "dc_identifier_s": "https://www.polardata.ca/pdcsearch/PDCSearchDOI.jsp?doi_id=13067", "dc_language_s": "eng; CAN", "dc_publisher_s": "Polar Data Catalogue", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_title_s": "Developing a Sensor to Detect Nutrients in Water", "dc_type_s": "dataset", "dct_temporal_sm": ["2018-12-01", "2020-12-31"], "dct_issued_s": "2019-11-21", "dct_provenance_s": "Canadian Cryospheric Information Network", "layer_slug_s": "13067", "layer_geom_type_s": "Point", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-80.541065,-80.541065,43.471964,43.471964)"}, {"geoblacklight_version": "1.0", "dc_description_s": "Rainbow darter, a type of fish,  from both upstream and downstream sites of the wastewater treatment plants, and will be aged using their ear bones (otoliths).

Ten undisturbed mesocosms were extracted from each site in Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cylinders measuring 12 cm in height and 10 cm in diameter. The holders were only filled to a depth of 10 cm. Each PVC sample holder was machined to accommodate a horizontally placed HP at a depth of 2.5 cm into the soil profile (4.5 cm below the top of the holder). This was complimented by the orthogonal insertion of two heat pulse probes, placed horizontally and diametrically opposed, covering the vertical span of the HP\u2019s sensing volume. The temperature and permittivity (\u2c89) were measured using HPs while two HPPs captured the apparent heat capacity at 24-minute intervals. The collected samples were placed in insulated cardboard boxes and filled with sand to laterally insulate the mesocosms and mimic a freezing front. The soil samples were subjected to temperature transitions from +10 \u00b0C to -10 \u00b0C and vice versa at ~24-hour intervals.

Due to natural processes such as precipitation change and rising temperatures, in addition to anthropogenic intervention, we notice a steadily increasing, and systemic pattern of permafrost thaw. The fieldwork took place in the Sahtu region of the Northwest Territories, specifically within the Bogg Creek Watershed, located 30 kilometers South of the Town of Norman Wells. Our work seeks to use two geophysical methods, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and electromagnetic induction (EMI) to estimate the permafrost table depth in areas with local landscape features such as lakes and clear cuts. The purpose of this research is also to benchmark a non-ground coupled system (EMI) against the more classical ground-coupled methods (ERT). The ERT system we used is the Syscal Junior 48, and the EMI system was the Geonics Inc EM-31 and EM-34. The field mission lasted four days, and we collected permafrost probe, ERT, and EMI measurements along three survey lines. Two lines (Line 001 and Line 002) were located at a drill pad site, labeled as MW04T, and another line (Line 004) was located near a lake\u2019s shoreline, labeled as \u201cMarg Lake\u201d. The permafrost probe showed a clear plunging of the permafrost table at the tree line at MW04T, and another plunge towards the lakeshore. The ERT data showed similar trends where the regions of high resistivity, representing ice/permafrost, plunged similar to our permafrost probe measurements. Our EMI measurements and interpretation also agreed with the permafrost probe measurements and ERT measurements, whereby a deepening of the permafrost table manifested itself in the data as increasing conductivity.

More physically realistic and sophisticated hydrological models driven by reliable climate forcing can provide the capability to assess hydrologic responses to climate change. However, hydrological processes in cold regions involve complex phase changes and so are very sensitive to small biases in the driving meteorology, particularly temperature and precipitation. Cold regions often have sparse surface observations, particularly at high elevations that generate the major amount of runoff. The effects of mountain topography and high latitudes are not well reflected in the observational record.
